# Documentation Update Summary
## What Changed from Old Docs to New Docs

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Version:** Old (1.0) ‚Üí New (2.0)  

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The old documentation was created **before the current explorer was fully built**. It had theoretical designs and patterns that didn't match what actually got implemented. The new documentation reflects the **actual working system** in tx-explorer-complete.html.

## üìä Major Changes

### V6 Update: Event Type Consolidation (October 29, 2025)

**Changed:** `DAODAO_CLAIM_NFTS` merged into `DAODAO_UNSTAKE`

**Why This Change Was Made:**
- `DAODAO_CLAIM_NFTS` was incorrectly classified as a reward claim (had "CLAIM" in the name)
- Got filtered out when "Hide Rewards" toggle was enabled
- Showed üí∞ reward bag icon instead of NFT thumbnail
- But it's actually an NFT operation (returning NFTs from staking to owner)

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Total event types: 25 ‚Üí 24
- ‚úÖ Shows NFT thumbnails (not reward bag)
- ‚úÖ Visible when rewards are hidden
- ‚úÖ Clearer event classification
- ‚úÖ Better filtering behavior

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Before:
if (rawStr.includes('claim_nfts')) {
    return 'DAODAO_CLAIM_NFTS';  // Separate event type
}
if (rawStr.includes('unstake')) {
    return 'DAODAO_UNSTAKE';
}

// After:
if (rawStr.includes('claim_nfts') || rawStr.includes('unstake')) {
    // Both are unstaking operations - return NFTs to owner
    return 'DAODAO_UNSTAKE';
}
```

**Example Transaction:**
`79855D6B36FA407A5E8AC940891E888B04742A6F5D18B08122F5093174B46A0E` (6 NFTs unstaked via claim_nfts)

**Documentation Updates:**
- Part 1: System Overview - Updated event count, DAODAO section
- Part 2: Event Detection - Merged sections, updated examples

---

### 1. NEW: Currency Display System
**Old Docs:** Did not exist  
**New Docs:** Complete documentation of 3-mode toggle

The explorer now has a currency toggle button (üí±) that cycles between:
- Token Mode: "249 bLUNA"
- LUNA Mode: "262.47 LUNA"  
- USD Mode: "$1,240.53 USD"

Users can also click any amount to see all three values in a popup.

**Where Documented:**
- Part 3: Data Extraction (technical implementation)
- Part 5: User Guide (how to use)

---

### 2. NEW: Interactive Element Documentation
**Old Docs:** Basic mention  
**New Docs:** Complete interaction guide

The explorer has many clickable elements:
- NFT thumbnails ‚Üí Full metadata modal
- Event badges ‚Üí Detection logic popup
- Timestamps ‚Üí Timezone conversions
- Amounts ‚Üí Currency values
- Addresses ‚Üí Copy to clipboard

**Where Documented:**
- Part 2: Event Detection (badge clicks)
- Part 4: Address Directory (address clicks)
- Part 5: User Guide (all interactions)

---

### 3. FIXED: CoinGecko Rate Limiting
**Old Docs:** Mentioned problem briefly  
**New Docs:** Complete solution documented

**The Problem:**
- 4 separate price list widgets
- 3 comparison charts loading immediately
- 1 converter
- Total: 8 API calls = instant rate limit (429 errors)

**The Solution:**
1. Combined 4 price lists into 1 widget
2. Lazy-load charts (only when tab clicked)
3. Delay converter by 3 seconds
4. Result: Only 3 initial API calls

**Where Documented:**
- Part 1: System Overview (architecture decision)
- Part 5: User Guide (troubleshooting section)

---

### 4. FIXED: Token Detection Problem
**Old Docs:** Not mentioned (didn't exist yet)  
**New Docs:** Problem and solution explained

**The Problem:**
BBL marketplace listings showed "249 LUNA" instead of "249 bLUNA" because the token prefix wasn't properly detected from the JSON data.

**The Solution:**
Smart token detection that checks:
1. Message funds (native tokens)
2. CW20 transfers in events
3. Platform-specific defaults (BBL = always bLUNA)
4. Contract addresses

**Where Documented:**
- Part 3: Data Extraction (complete detection logic)

---

### 5. NEW: Multi-Month Selector

```bash
# In your docs repository:
rm -rf old_docs/
mkdir current_docs/
cp *.md current_docs/

# Update README links
# Update footer links in explorer HTML
```

### 2. Update Explorer Footer Links
In `tx-explorer-complete.html`, update the documentation section:

```html
<div class="docs-links">
    <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/docs/README.md">‚Üí Documentation Home</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/docs/01-system-overview.md">‚Üí Part 1: System Overview</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/docs/02-event-detection.md">‚Üí Part 2: Event Detection</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/docs/03-data-extraction.md">‚Üí Part 3: Data Extraction</a>
