## üìù Documentation Standards

### Writing Style
- ‚úÖ Clear, concise explanations
- ‚úÖ Code examples with comments
- ‚úÖ Real transaction references
- ‚úÖ Visual diagrams where helpful
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step tutorials

### Code Examples
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Commented, realistic
function extractAmount(tx) {
  // Try message funds first
  const funds = tx.body.messages[0]?.funds;
  if (funds && funds.length > 0) {
    return funds[0].amount;
  }
  // Fallback to events
  return extractFromEvents(tx);
}

// ‚ùå Bad: No context, unclear
function get(tx) {
  return tx.body.messages[0].funds[0].amount;
}
```

### Updating Documentation
When code changes:
1. Update affected .md file(s)
2. Add to "What's New" section
3. Update version number
4. Test all code examples
5. Update screenshots if UI changed

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Client-Side Processing** - Large datasets (1000+ TXs) may be slow
2. **CoinGecko Rate Limits** - Prices limited to ~10 calls/minute
3. **Browser Memory** - Very large month loads may lag
4. **Mobile UX** - Table scrolling on small screens is awkward
5. **Historical Data** - Only back to Oct 2024 (when tracking began)

### Workarounds
1. Use event filters to reduce displayed data
2. Lazy-load charts (implemented in V4)
3. Load specific months, not all at once
4. Use desktop/tablet for best experience
5. More historical data added monthly
